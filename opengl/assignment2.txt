In this assignment, you will replace the raytracer with OpenGL Pipeline. The scene will largely be the same as the previous assignment with the following changes:
The snowman will have a textured smily face. So, will all spheres.
There will not be any (invisible) walls, but include a floor.
There will be only two lights, and no tube-lights displayed.
A camera light (that stays at the same location as the camera), and
A "headlight" at the top of the snowman's head.
There will be no glass balls. They shiny spheres are all specular, but half are highly smooth and the rest are highly rough.
All materials absorb 50% of the light.
You should convert a sphere's geometry to triangles offline, and save it in a file. Devise a generic reader for your scene (which should instance the same phere multiple times; the partial sphere may have a separate file).
There will be 3 extra credits for making the floor wet (almost mirror like), and drawing shadow on the floor.

The interface will be a bit more general:

Selecting a background pixel and dragging the mouse should rotate the camera (left to right or up to down). If the shrft button is simultaneously pressed, the camera should move in camera-Z, depending on the mouse's Y copordinate.
Selecting a shiny ball and dragging the mouse should translate it in Camera-X or Camera-Y (mapped respectively from mouse X and mouse Y).
Selecting the base sphere of the snowman and dragging should rotate the entire snowman about its contact with the ground.
Selecting the torso of the snowman and dragging should rotate the torso and the head about the base's center.
Selecting the head of the snowman and dragging should rotate the head about the torso's center.
